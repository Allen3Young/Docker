## Docker Installation Guide
- For docker, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
- For NVIDIA Container Toolkit, See https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker

## Run the Docker daemon as a non-root user 
1. Install
 ```bash
 curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/rootless | sh
 ```
 You might get suggestions to install some dependencies (e.g. *uidmap*), do it.

According to the [info] you get after the previous command complete, follow the instruction to add the environment variables to `~/.bashrc`.
Don't forget run `source ~/.bashrc` after adding the environment variables

2. Setting for GPU access in non-root user mode, in file `/etc/nvidia-container-runtime/config.toml`

setting
```
no-cgroups = true
```

3. Restart the Docker daemon (not sure if it is necessary)
```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

4. Test if you have access to gpu in a docker container
```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --privileged nvidia/cuda:11.3.1-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi

```
 Uninstall if you want
 ```bash
 dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh uninstall
 ```
